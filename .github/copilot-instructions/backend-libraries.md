# Backend Libraries (Next.js API Routes) ðŸ’¾

The API logic must adhere to the following library choices for the formatting pipeline. Do not suggest running external non-Node.js processes (like native Python/Java executables) unless absolutely necessary for the formatter/beautifier tool that lacks a native JS/TS binding.

## Required Libraries

### Code Highlighting
- Use **`highlight.js`** for syntax highlighting
- The output must be HTML with CSS classes applied

### JavaScript Formatting
- Use **`prettier`** for all JavaScript/TypeScript beautification and indentation

### RTF Conversion (Critical)
- Use or prioritize libraries that can convert **HTML â†’ RTF** (e.g., look for `html-to-rtf` packages or suggest creating a custom utility wrapper around a reliable RTF standard library for Node.js)
- This step must preserve the colors/styles generated by `highlight.js`
