# Code Style & Maintainability

## Naming Conventions

- **PascalCase** for React Components and TypeScript Interfaces/Types
- **camelCase** for variables and functions

## Indentation

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation across all languages (TS, Python, Java)

## TypeScript

- **Always use TypeScript** - All new code must be written in TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- Follow ESLint rules configured in the project

## Component Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

## Specific Conventions

- Use `'use client'` directive only when client-side features are required
- Prefer server-side rendering for better performance and SEO
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow the existing project structure and patterns
- Document complex algorithms and formatting logic
