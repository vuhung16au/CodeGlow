# Copilot Instructions Directory

This directory contains modular instruction files for GitHub Copilot to help maintain and develop the CodeGlow project effectively.

## Structure

Each file focuses on a specific aspect of the project:

- **project-overview.md** - Project description, purpose, and core functionality
- **technology-stack.md** - Technology stack, architecture, and framework choices
- **backend-libraries.md** - Required libraries for the formatting pipeline
- **core-logic.md** - Core logic flow and output requirements
- **code-style.md** - Code style, naming conventions, and maintainability
- **next-js-best-practices.md** - Next.js-specific best practices and conventions
- **performance.md** - Performance optimization guidelines
- **accessibility.md** - Accessibility requirements and best practices
- **security.md** - Security guidelines and best practices
- **testing.md** - Testing requirements and strategies

## Usage

These files are automatically loaded by GitHub Copilot to provide context-aware assistance. The main `copilot-instructions.md` file in the `.github` directory provides a comprehensive overview with links to these detailed topic files.

## Maintaining These Files

When updating instructions:
1. Keep each file focused on its specific topic
2. Use clear, actionable language
3. Update the main `copilot-instructions.md` if new files are added
4. Ensure consistency across all files
